\chapter*{Preface}

This is my scribes while taking the "Introduction to Property Testing" course at Reichman University during the Spring term of 2022.
The course was given by Dr. Reut Levi.
I have been trying to closely follow the contents and adding some explanations as I see fit, especially when I have personally found them helpful.
